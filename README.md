# Solar_WiFi_Weather_Station
Based on the work of Open Green Energy.
https://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Powered-WiFi-Weather-Station-V20/
Authors of the base code: Keith Hungerford and Debasish Dutta - Excellent work, gentlemen!

Major changes:
- simplified, restructured code (used Adafruit libraries for BME280 instead)
- added relative pressure, dewpoint and heatindex calculations
- allow both, Blynk and ThingSpeak API together
- redesigned box (simplified printing, less plastic usage, full snap-in)
